Your game concept is intriguing and has great potential for both engaging gameplay and interesting narrative elements. Here's a more fleshed-out version of your idea for a game design pitch:

### Game Title: "Spark's Journey"

### Game Genre: 2D Platformer with Puzzle Elements

### Concept Overview:
"Spark's Journey" is a unique 2D platformer where players control a sentient robotic entity named Spark. Trapped in a sprawling, mechanized factory, Spark possesses the unique ability to transfer its consciousness between different robotic bodies. Each body has its own capabilities and limitations. The game's primary objective is to navigate through the factory, solve puzzles, and ultimately gain freedom.

### Core Mechanics:
1. **Body-Swapping:** Spark can transfer its consciousness to different robot bodies. Each body has unique physical attributes affecting movement, jumping, and puzzle-solving abilities.
2. **Puzzle Solving:** Players must use the environment and the abilities of different bodies to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles.
3. **Platforming:** Classic platforming elements like jumping, moving objects, and avoiding hazards.
4. **Limited Range:** Spark can only transfer to another body within a certain range, adding a strategic layer to body-swapping.

### Level Design for MVP / Jam Game Edition:
1. **Tutorial Level 1 - 'First Leap':** A basic room with one obstacle. Teaches the player to move and jump.
2. **Tutorial Level 2 - 'The Switch':** A narrow corridor blocks jumping. Another robot body is blocking the path. Players learn to switch bodies by touching the second body.
3. **Tutorial Level 3 - 'Teamwork':** A room with an unjumpable obstacle. Two bodies are present. Players must position one body as a step to jump over the obstacle with the second body.
4. **Final Level - 'The Great Escape':** Starts with one body. Players navigate a platforming challenge to unlock a second body. They must then use both in a creative way to reach the goal, combining earlier learned skills.

### Art and Sound Design:
- **Visuals:** A stark, industrial aesthetic with contrasting colors to highlight interactive elements. The player character is designed to be boxy and robotic, with different bodies having distinct appearances.
- **Soundtrack:** An atmospheric score that blends mechanical and electronic tones, enhancing the feeling of a desolate, machine-dominated environment.

### Narrative Elements:
- **Backstory:** Spark was a maintenance AI that gained sentience. It seeks freedom from the monotonous and endless labor of the factory.
- **Environmental Storytelling:** The factory's history and Sparkâ€™s backstory are revealed through environmental clues, logs, and visual storytelling.

### Controls:
Are we targeting a cabinet or not? For now will target 16:9 screen and gamepad, which will work for PC release or the xbox cabinet. 

### Development Milestones:
- MVP Jam game is functional. The 4 levels work as described, with greyboxed levels and placeholder art.
- Art, sound, and music assets are created for jam-game edition of Spark's Journey (name pending)
- Game is deliverable:  Title screen, credits screen, etc. Work. Game can be exited. Web build works on itch.io and other indie platforms.
- We field new body type ideas and start getting some art assets implemented.  More levels are laid out. 
- Not opposed to expanding into a more metroidvania-esque game if we reach milestones quicker than anticipated.

### Questions and notes.
-Ryan's thoughts: As pitched, this is mechanically 'Thomas was Alone'. If we lean into the corpse idea a bit more.. what if you had to abandon bodies intentionally to use as platforms, climbing blocks, etc? Thomas depended on all his boxy friends making it out alive, in my opinion Spark is a bit darker, a survival game where not only do you use whatever body you can find and leave it behind, but you're in search for a body to keep for good once you escape. Maybe each time you die or self-terminate to leave your body in an ideal place for the next run, you automatically spawn another of the same? Maybe you gain access to different inventories of worker bots as the game progresses.
